ช่วงนี้หาตำแหน่งใหม่

# Don't give a f*ck about your company career path
ํYour interest is not your company's interest
One size doesn't fit all
Only for getting a raise Or short term goal
Can you swap job?
Worst, this is setup by HR. No interest.
Don't care about job title

# Career Development is your responsibility, not your manager's or mom's

# Do not set goal on technology
I wanna set up fullstack (not Docker, abc, etc.)

I want to have xxx,xxx salary in yyy year

I want to work only xx hour by the age of yyy but still have sustainable income of ddd

# Plan specifically and track systematically


# Find the right question before seeking mentor
